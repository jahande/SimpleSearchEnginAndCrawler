Her father was Owen Jones, a lecturer in chemistry, and her mother was Ida Sp?rck, a Norwegian who moved to Britain during World War II. They left Norway on one of the last boats out after the German invasion in 1940.[2] Sp?rck Jones was educated at a grammar school in Huddersfield and then Girton College, Cambridge from 1953 to 1956, reading History, with an additional final year in Moral Sciences (philosophy). She briefly became a school teacher, before moving into Computer Science. During her career in Computer Science, she campaigned hard for more women to enter computing.[2] She was married to fellow Cambridge computer scientist Roger Needham until his death in 2003. She died 4 April 2007 at Willingham in Cambridgeshire. Career[edit] She worked at the Cambridge Language Research Unit from the late 1950s,[5] then at Cambridge's Computer Laboratory from 1974, and retired in 2002, holding the post of Professor of Computers and Information, which she was awarded in 1999.[2] She continued to work in the Computer Laboratory until shortly before her death. Her main research interests, since the late 1950s, were natural language processing and information retrieval.[6][7] One of her most important contributions was the concept of inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting in information retrieval, which she introduced in a 1972 paper.[6][8] IDF is used in most search engines today, usually as part of the tf-idf weighting scheme.[9] There is an annual BCS lecture named in her honour.[10] Honours[edit] Fellow of the British Academy, of which she was Vice-President in 2000–02 Fellow of AAAI Fellow of ECCAI President of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 1994 Awards[edit] Gerard Salton Award (1988) ASIS&T Award of Merit (2002) ACL Lifetime Achievement Award (2004) BCS Lovelace Medal (2007) ACM-AAAI Allen Newell Award (2007) References[edit] ^ Karen Sp?rck Jones (1986).
