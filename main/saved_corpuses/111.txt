He coined the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia" in 1963 and published them in 1965. Nelson has also been credited as being the first person to use the words transclusion, virtuality, intertwingularity, and teledildonics.

While there, he made an experimental humorous student film titled The Epiphany of Slocum Furlow in which the titular hero discovers the meaning of life. His contemporary at the college, Peter Schickele scored the film.[3] In 1960 Nelson began graduate work at Harvard University in philosophy, earning a master's degree in sociology in 1963. Much later in life, in 2002, he obtained a Doctorate in Media and Governance from Keio University. During college and graduate school, he envisioned a computer-based writing system that would provide a lasting repository for the world's knowledge and also permit greater flexibility of drawing connections between ideas. This came to be known as Project Xanadu. Xanadu[edit] Main article: Project Xanadu Nelson founded Project Xanadu in 1960 with the goal of creating a computer network with a simple user interface. The effort is documented in his 1974 book Computer Lib / Dream Machines and the 1981 Literary Machines. Much of his adult life has been devoted to working on Xanadu and advocating it. The Xanadu project itself failed to flourish, for a variety of reasons which are disputed. Journalist Gary Wolf published an unflattering history on Nelson and his project in the June 1995 issue of Wired magazine, calling it "the longest-running vaporware project in the history of computing".[4] Nelson expressed his disgust with the assertions on his website,referring to Wolf as "Gory Jackal", and threatened to sue him.[5] He also outlined his objections in a letter to Wired,[6] and released a detailed rebuttal of the article.[7] Nelson has stated that some aspects of his vision are being fulfilled by Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web, but he dislikes the World Wide Web, XML and all embedded markup – regarding Berners-Lee's work as a gross over-simplification of his original vision: HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT— ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.[8] Jaron Lanier explains the difference between the World Wide Web and Nelson's vision, and the implications: A core technical difference between a Nelsonian network and what we have become familiar with online is that [Nelson's] network links were two-way instead of one-way. In a network with two-way links, each node knows what other nodes are linked to it. ... Two-way linking would preserve context. It's a small simple change in how online information should be stored that couldn't have vaster implications for culture and the economy."[9] Other projects[edit] In 1965, he presented the paper "Complex Information Processing: A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate" at the ACM National Conference, in which he coined the term "hypertext".[10] Nelson co-founded Itty bitty machine company, or "ibm", which was a small computer retail store operating from 1977 to 1980 in Evanston, Illinois. The Itty bitty machine company was one of the few retail stores to sell the original Apple I computer. In 1978 he had a significant impact upon IBM's thinking when he outlined his vision of the potential of personal computing to the team that three years later launched the IBM PC.[11] ZigZag[edit] Main article: ZigZag (software) He is currently working on a new information structure, ZigZag,[12] which is described on the Xanadu project website, which also hosts two versions of the Xanadu code. He also developed XanaduSpace, a system for the exploration of connected parallel documents (an early version of this software may be freely downloaded).[13] Influence and recognition[edit] In January 1988 BYTE computer journal published an article about Nelson's ideas, titled; "Managing Immense Storage". This stimulated discussions within the computer industry, and encouraged people to experiment with Hypertext features. In 1998, at the Seventh WWW Conference in Brisbane, Australia, Nelson was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award. In 2001 he was knighted by France as "Officier des Arts et Lettres". In 2004 he was appointed as a Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and associated with the Oxford Internet Institute, where he was a visiting fellow from 2004 through 2006.[14] In 2007 he celebrated his 70th birthday by giving an invited lecture at the University of Southampton.[15] Quotes[edit] “A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds.”[citation needed] “We should not impose regularity where it does not exist.”[16] “I hope, that in our archives and historical filings of the future, we do not allow the techie traditions of hierarchy and false regularity to be superimposed to the teeming, fantastic disorderlyness of human life.”[16] “The World Wide Web was precisely what we were trying to PREVENT— ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.”[17] Neologisms[edit] He is credited with coining several new words that have come into common usage especially in the world of computing. Among them are: "hypertext" and "hypermedia" were both coined by Nelson in 1963 and first published in 1965. transclusion virtuality intertwingularity teledildonics Populitism is a portmanteau combining "populism" with "elite."[18] Publications[edit] Many of his books are published through his own company, Mindful Press.[19] Life, Love, College, etc. (1959) Computer Lib: You can and must understand computers now / Dream Machines: New freedoms through computer screens—a minority report (1974), Microsoft Press, revised edition 1987: ISBN 0-914845-49-7[20] The Home Computer Revolution (1977) Literary Machines: The report on, and of, Project Xanadu concerning word processing, electronic publishing, hypertext, thinkertoys, tomorrow's intellectual revolution, and certain other topics including knowledge, education and freedom (1981), Mindful Press, Sausalito, California; publication dates as listed in the 93.1 (1993) edition: 1980–84, 1987, 1990–93 The Future of Information (1997) A Cosmology for a Different Computer Universe: Data Model, Mechanisms, Virtual Machine and Visualization Infrastructure.
