Communications of the ACM - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Communications of the ACM From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Communications of the ACM Editor-in-chief Moshe Y.

Established in 1957, CACM is sent to all ACM members, currently numbering over 100,000.[1] The articles are intended for readers with backgrounds in all areas of computer science and information systems. The focus is on the practical implications of advances in information technology and associated management issues; ACM also publishes a variety of more theoretical journals. CACM straddles the boundary of a science magazine, professional journal, and a scientific journal. While the content is subject to peer review (and is counted as such in many university assessments of research output), the articles published are often summaries of research that may also be published elsewhere. Material published must be accessible and relevant to a broad readership. On the publisher's website, CACM is filed in the category "magazines".[2] Contents 1 Notable articles 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Notable articles[edit] Some notable articles are:[according to whom?][original research?] The issue of what to call the then-fledgling field of computer science was raised by the editors of DATA-LINK in a letter to the editor of CACM, appearing in 1958, the first year of CACM. They called for giving the field a name "which is brief, definite, distinctive".[3] The call was echoed by a wide range of suggestions, including comptology (Quentin Correll),[4] hypology (P.A. Zaphyr),[5] and datalogy (Peter Naur).[6] C. A. R. Hoare's Quicksort.[7] Martin Davis, George Logemann and Donald Loveland described in 1962 the DPLL algorithm, containing the essential algorithm on which most modern SAT solvers are based.[8] The "Revised report on the algorithm language ALGOL 60": A landmark paper in programming language design describing the result of the international ALGOL committee.[9] Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl's original paper on Simula-67.[10] Edsger W. Dijkstra's famous letter inveighing against the use of GOTO.[11] The letter was reprinted in Jan 2008 in the 60th anniversary edition of CACM.[12] Dijkstra's original paper on the THE operating system. This paper's appendix, arguably even more influential than its main body, introduced semaphore-based synchronization.[13] Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard M. Adleman's first public-key cryptosystem (RSA).[14] See also[edit] Journal of the ACM References[edit] ^ Alain Chesnais (2013). "ACM's Annual Report for FY12".
