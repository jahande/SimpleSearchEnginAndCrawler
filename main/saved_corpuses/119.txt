Nicholas J. Belkin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nicholas J. Belkin From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Nicholas J. Belkin Fields Computer Science Institutions Rutgers University Known for Anomalous State of Knowledge for Information Retrieval Nicholas J. Belkin is a professor at the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University. Among the main themes of his research are digital libraries; information-seeking behaviors; and interaction between humans and information retrieval systems. Belkin is best known for his work on human-centered Information Retrieval and the hypothesis of Anomalous State of Knowledge (ASK). Belkin realized that in many cases, users of search systems are unable to precisely formulate what they need. They miss some vital knowledge to formulate their queries. In such cases it is more suitable to attempt to describe a user's anomalous state of knowledge than to ask the user to specify her/his need as a request to the system.[1][2] Dr. Belkin was the chair of SIGIR in 1995-99, and the president of American Society for Information Science and Technology in 2005.[3] References[edit] ^ Belkin, N.J.
