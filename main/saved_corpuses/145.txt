Structured Search - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Structured Search From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search This article relies on references to primary sources. Please add references to secondary or tertiary sources. (October 2013) Structured search is a patented search technology. Structured queries can comprise numeric and other predicates generally not supported by the traditional keyword search (Information retrieval), and allow controlling the order of items in the output. Unlike the keyword search oriented mainly towards humans, the structured search facilitates programmatic processing of search results by other systems or applications, which can also generate structured queries automatically. Like information retrieval uses keywords for querying unstructured data, structured search uses key-objects (query objects) for querying structured data or semi-structured data without knowing the organization or the number of heterogeneous data sources queried simultaneously. For e-commerce and mobile e-commerce structured search allows finding merchandise or services by specifications rather than by keywords needed to get to specifications (like brand or model). This can save many hours spent by shoppers researching goods and services online in order to get the best deals.
