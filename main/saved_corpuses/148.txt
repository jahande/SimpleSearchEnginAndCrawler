tf–idf - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia tf–idf From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Tf-idf) Jump to: navigation, search tf–idf, term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.[1]:8 It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to control for the fact that some words are generally more common than others. Variations of the tf–idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query. tf–idf can be successfully used for stop-words filtering in various subject fields including text summarization and classification. One of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf–idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.

A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words "the", "brown", and "cow", but this still leaves many documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document and sum them all together; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term frequency. However, because the term "the" is so common, this will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word "the" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms "brown" and "cow". The term "the" is not a good keyword to distinguish relevant and non-relevant documents and terms, unlike the less common words "brown" and "cow". Hence an inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely. Mathematical details[edit] tf–idf is the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document frequency. Various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics exist. In the case of the term frequency tf(t,d), the simplest choice is to use the raw frequency of a term in a document, i.e. the number of times that term t occurs in document d. If we denote the raw frequency of t by f(t,d), then the simple tf scheme is tf(t,d) = f(t,d). Other possibilities include[2]:118 Boolean "frequencies": tf(t,d) = 1 if t occurs in d and 0 otherwise; logarithmically scaled frequency: tf(t,d) = log (f(t,d) + 1); augmented frequency, to prevent a bias towards longer documents, e.g. raw frequency divided by the maximum raw frequency of any term in the document: The inverse document frequency is a measure of whether the term is common or rare across all documents. It is obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term, and then taking the logarithm of that quotient. with : cardinality of D, or the total number of documents in the corpus  : number of documents where the term appears (i.e., ). If the term is not in the corpus, this will lead to a division-by-zero. It is therefore common to adjust the formula to . Mathematically the base of the log function does not matter and constitutes a constant multiplicative factor towards the overall result. Then tf–idf is calculated as A high weight in tf–idf is reached by a high term frequency (in the given document) and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents; the weights hence tend to filter out common terms. Since the ratio inside the idf's log function is always greater than or equal to 1, the value of idf (and tf-idf) is greater than or equal to 0. As a term appears in more documents, the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1, bringing the idf and tf-idf closer to 0. Various (mathematical) forms of the tf–idf term weight can be derived from a probabilistic retrieval model that mimics human relevance decision making.[citation needed] See also[edit] Okapi BM25 Noun phrase Word count Vector Space Model PageRank Kullback-Leibler divergence Mutual Information Latent semantic analysis Latent semantic indexing Latent Dirichlet allocation References[edit] This article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations.
