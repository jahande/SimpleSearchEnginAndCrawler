Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search This category is not shown on its member pages, unless the appropriate user preference is set. User:Citation bot helps editors to keep citations in a consistent format within a given article. If a mix of {citation} and {cite xx} templates are used, the bot will convert all citations to the dominant type (as they differ in details of punctuation). It will preserve the original formatting, in case it was intentional. However, in most cases, the editor did not realize that the added citation did match the format in the article. Therefore the bot adds a hidden comment and a category (via a template to avoid confusing AWB) to any template that it changes. Human editors should check these comments and see if the citations they are found in should genuinely have different punctuation to other citations on the page. They should then amend the |postscript= parameter accordingly, removing {{inconsistent citations}}.
