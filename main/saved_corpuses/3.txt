Fathers of information science Paul Otlet Henri La Fontaine Information history International Federation for Information and Documentation History of information representation and retrieval Has undergone four phases of development[2] Increased Demand (1940s–early 1950s) (Information explosion) Rapid Growth (1950s–1980s) (the emergence of computers and systems such as Dialog (online database)) Demystification Phase (1980s–1990s) (systems developed for end-user searching) The Networked Era (1990s–Present) (search enginees such as AltaVista and Google) Research methods of information science[edit] Archival research – facts or factual evidences from a variety of records are compiled. Computational complexity and structure – algorithmic and graphic methods are used to explore the complexity of information systems, retrieval and storage. Content analysis – studies how people communicate by analyzing the contents of books and mass media as well as the messages people talk or write about. Case study – specific set of circumstances or a group (the 'case') is analyzed according to a specific goal of study. Generally, case studies are used to characterize a trend or development; they have weak generalizability. Discourse analysis – analyzing written, oral, and sign language use Historical method – involves a continuous and systematic search for the information and knowledge about past events related to the life of a person, a group, society, or the world. Interviews – researchers obtain data by interviewing people. If the interview is non-structured, the researcher leaves it to the interviewee (also referred to as the respondent or the informant) to guide the conversation. Life history – study of the personal life of a person. Through a series of interviews, the researcher can probe into the decisive moments in their life or the various influences on their life. Longitudinal study – extensive examination of a specific group over a long period of time. Observation – using data from the senses, one records information about a social phenomenon or behavior. Qualitative research relies heavily on observation, although it is in a highly disciplined form. Participant observation – involves researchers going into the field (usually a community), living with the people for some time, and participating in their activities in order to know and feel their culture.

Some of them are: Archival science Communication studies Computer science Documentation science Informatics Information management Information systems research Information literacy Informing science Internet studies Knowledge management Library science Media studies Records management Scientometrics Information science organizations[edit] American Society for Information Science and Technology Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP) Society of Information Technology Management (SOCITM), related group based in the UK Related governmental agencies[edit] National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Educational institutions[edit] Information school List of Information Schools Information science awards[edit] Claude E.
