(January 2010) The Generalized vector space model is a generalization of the vector space model used in information retrieval. Wong et al.[1] presented an analysis of the problems that the pairwise orthogonality assumption of the vector space model (VSM) creates. From here they extended the VSM to the generalized vector space model (GVSM). Definitions[edit] GVSM introduces term to term correlations, which deprecate the pairwise orthogonality assumption. More specifically, they are considered a new space, where each term vector ti was expressed as a linear combination of 2n vectors mr where r = 1...2n. For a document dk and a query q the similarity function now becomes: where ti and tj are now vectors of a 2n dimensional space. Term correlation can be implemented in several ways. As an example Wong et al. use as input to their algorithm the term occurrence frequency matrix obtained from automatic indexing and the output is term correlation between any pair of index terms. Semantic information on GVSM[edit] There are at least two basic directions for embedding term to term relatedness, other than exact keyword matching, into a retrieval model: compute semantic correlations between terms compute frequency co-occurrence statistics from large corpora Recently Tsatsaronis[2] focused on the first approach. They measure semantic relatedness (SR) using a thesaurus (O) like WordNet. It considers the path length, captured by compactness (SCM), and the path depth, captured by semantic path elaboration (SPE). They estimate the inner product by: where si and sj are senses of terms ti and tj respectively, maximizing . References[edit] ^ Wong, S. K. M.; Wojciech Ziarko, Patrick C. N.
