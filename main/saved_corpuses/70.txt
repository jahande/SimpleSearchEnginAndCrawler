Co-occurrence - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Co-occurrence From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Co-occurrence or cooccurrence is a linguistics term that can either mean concurrence / coincidence or, in a more specific sense, the above-chance frequent occurrence of two terms from a text corpus alongside each other in a certain order. Co-occurrence in this linguistic sense can be interpreted as an indicator of semantic proximity or an idiomatic expression. In contrast to collocation, co-occurrence assumes interdependency of the two terms. A co-occurrence restriction is identified when linguistic elements never occur together. Analysis of these restrictions can lead to discoveries about the structure and development of a language.[1] See also[edit] Linguistics portal Correlation Distributional hypothesis Statistical semantics Co-occurrence matrix Co-occurrence networks References[edit] ^ Kroeger, Paul (2005).
